# Hey, I'm Esteban 👋

I'm a Computer Science student and aspiring Software Engineer, currently building full‑stack applications with a focus on clean architecture, great UX, and professional development workflows.

I love turning ideas into real, polished projects — from backend APIs to frontend interfaces — and I'm always learning, experimenting, and refining my craft.

---

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
- **Donee** — a full-stack app with a clean FastAPI backend, modular services, domain errors, JWT auth, and a modern frontend.
- Building strong foundations in **software engineering**, not just coding.
- Improving my UI/UX skills with thoughtful design tokens, components, and responsive layouts.

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack & Tools

### **Backend**
- Python • FastAPI • SQLAlchemy • PostgreSQL  
- Authentication flows (JWT, password hashing, reset codes)  
- Clean architecture: routers → services → repositories → models  

### **Dev Tools**
- Git & GitHub (branches, clean commits, PR-style workflow)  
- Pre-commit hooks (black, isort, flake8)  
- VS Code • Postman • Docker (learning)

---

## 📚 What I'm Learning Next
- Advanced frontend (React or Vue)
- Deeper database design & migrations
- Testing (pytest, integration tests)
- Deployment & CI/CD

---

## 🎨 My Approach
I care about:
- Clean, readable, maintainable code  
- Thoughtful project structure  
- Professional workflows  
- Learning through building  
- Balancing logic with design
